# When STOCK price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").

price_diff = (price_yesterday - price_previous) / price_previous * 100

## STEP 2: Use https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything
# Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually fetch the first 3 articles for the COMPANY_NAME. 

if price_diff < -4 or price_diff > 4:
    print("Get news")

    print(price_diff)
    print(news_data[0]["title"])
    print(news_data[0]["description"])

    print(price_diff)
    print(news_data[1]["title"])
    print(news_data[1]["description"])

    print(price_diff)
    print(news_data[2]["title"])
    print(news_data[2]["description"])

## STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
# Send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number. 
#HINT 1: Consider using a List Comprehension.



#Optional: Format the SMS message like this:
